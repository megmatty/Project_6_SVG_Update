# Project_6_SVG_Update
----
This is my sixth project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Attempted to hit all exceeds criteria
  * Inline SVGs added for all iamges including dogs, except the background pattern
  * CSS hover and transitions added to menu icons, with underline effect
  * CSS scale effect added to logo and dogs
* Tested on a Mac with Safari 9.1, Chrome 50, Firefox 46
* HTML valiates 100%. CSS validates except for permitted errors (svg fill property and vendor prefixes).
* This was a surprisingly fun project to do once I got used to looking at the svg code, and was able to visually organize it.

**Needs Work or Need to Learn:**
* Using multiple inline svgs definitely takes some planning to organize CSS classes and ids, I refactored but I bet in the future I
could do even more code tightening

~Time to complete: Probably only a couple hours - I had business travel interrupt my week and so the work was spread out over a few days.
